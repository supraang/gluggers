### Savage Sinusoid Review by Unown

Savage Sinusoid is a album by [Igorrr](https://igorrr.com).

#### Viande

worst igorrr track ever probably, its just trying to sound funny art-rock screaming over generic metal electronic that probably turned away 43969 people from listening to the rest of the album

#### ieuD

would have been a way better intro than Viande, actually works in demonstrating igorrr style on a basic level to metal babies on the new label igorrr joined for this album Metalblade, other than that its absolutely terrible for igorrr standards, Barbecue was a better opener. its way too noisy, its just walls of noise during the metal parts and this awful harpischord coated in 99 layers of reverb the only part i like is the 5 seconds of recorder at the end which shouldve been a huge component of the track in my opinion

#### Houmous

a really really good 50 seconds that was extended to 3 and a half minutes just for filler, all the sections last way too long and go nowhere, the chiptune ending shouldve been part of the actual track instead of stuck onto the end after a second of silence. If this track was made during Hallelujah it would be a masterpiece

#### Opus Brain

3 good ideas with minutes of filler in between them. The intro, the harp or whatever it is solo at 2:25, and the volume increase at the end are the ideas and everything else is basically white noise: generic dnb and generic metalcore that don't even interact or accentuate or contrast eachother in any way

#### Probleme demotion

Obligatory slow track, the trend started from igorrrs first album and continued here, except here he does the bare minimum, in 2006 he made Dixit Dominus which was just a super saiyan requiem version of this track, doesn't go anywhere until over 2 minutes in and then its already half over. I cant even say more about this track because its so void of content. I do like the last 30 seconds except when he decided to recycle the same sample for an ENTIRE TRACK later on

#### Spaghetti Forever

best track on the album but still not up to par of everything else igorrr ever made, first minute is acoustic guitar filler that shouldve only been used once and way shorter but its used twice because the final minute of the track is also the same thing so its 2 minutes of filler in this 4 minute track. Besides that its the absolute bare minimum igorrr, opera singing metal scream growl over electronic does nothing new until the church organ at 2:11 when its overlayed with the violin which is a sound combo igorrr didnt do yet but then its immediately interrupted with just screaming again which is super tame after Unpleasant Sonata's unmatched execution of it. interrupting a calm soundscape with screaming will never be cool again after unpleasant sonata and cuisse

#### Cheval

this track has the best execution on the album of the igorrr formula of taking 1 instrument and overlaying it with different contrasting or accentuating sounds, growling+accordion, dubstep+accordion, besides those short sections it feels like a really simplistic version of a vladmir bozar track, just goes through all the normal stuff igorrr does, again nothing new, meanwhile on old albums he'd go through multiple new ideas in a single track

#### Apopadfigjsfsmersphobie

This track is actually good. because its not igorrr its just a tame Whourkr. im holding it to past igorrr album standards so its bad.

#### Va te foutre

most forgettable on the album, it has no layers or evolution whatsoever, nothing happens in this track its just a sound repeated for 1:45 and near the middle it changes a tiny bit so yuo think something will happen but then it goes back to the same sound again for the rest. i was wrong this is the worst on the album not viande

#### Robert

the dubstep synth from the end of Probleme demotion but made into an entire track. Its the Very Long Chicken format of taking one sound and just repeating it over and over and playing with it and adding random sounds in sometimes. it doesnt change enough to be interesting though and after 2:05 the rest of the track is generic dubstep metal that does nothing

#### Au Revoir

just like apopajkdfivsdjphobie its a really tame version of another igorrr project, this time its Corpo-Mente, then it becomes metal again. what the hell happened to igorrr's love for a variety of sounds and textures and constant new ideas what happend to that. album over
